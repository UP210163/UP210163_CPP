Select 1 since we are going to play vs. the PC. The game board will appear with numbers from 1 to 9 to select the move.   
<img src="../imagenes/gato2.png" align="center">  
Now we will start playing against the PC, my first move is on cell 5. On the other hand, the PC's first move is always random.  
<img src="../imagenes/gato3.png" align="center">  
My second move is on cell 9. The computer now counters by placing its move on cell 1.   
<img src="../imagenes/gato4.png" align="center">  
My third move is on cell 7 to prevent the computer from winning. The PC counters by putting his move in cell 3 to prevent me from winning.
<img src="../imagenes/gato5.png" align="center">  
My fourth move is in cell 8. The CP counters by putting their move in cell 8 to prevent me from winning.
